\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  In the directional derivative section, we have seen how we can linearise the potential energy or any function, functional
		\item We get our equilibrium equation $\ve{Kx = F}$
		\item This equation can be nonlinear with respect to $x$. So we have a residual function  $\ve{R(x)= Kx - F}$ which again can be thought as something that we can find the linear change
