	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Tensors are objects. An object is a some physical quantity that you can say exists in real life. Examples are forces, stresses etc.
		
		\item Each tensor has a co-ordinate frame where you can describe it. For eg : You would need to define a vector by how much it goes in unit basis directions like $e^1, e^2, e^3$. So we can say that a vector may be defined as (3,4,5) and so on.
